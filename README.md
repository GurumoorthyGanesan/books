## Essential Books Project

This project is a continuation of Stack Overflow Documentation, which
ended in [Augutst 2017](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/354217/sunsetting-documentation).

The intent is to preserve the work that's been done so far and improve upon it.

Guiding principles behind Essential Books:
* driven by examples
* articles are small and heavily interlinked
* not limited by size

This project is collaborative. All documentation is released under [Creative Commons BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) license.
