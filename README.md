## Essential Books Project

This project is a continuation of Stack Overflow Documentation, which
ended in [Augutst 2017](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/354217/sunsetting-documentation).

The intent is to preserve the work that's been done so far and improve upon it.

Guiding principles behind Essential Books:
* fast
* driven by examples

Fast means: fast to find the information. Here's how we make the documentation fast:
* this website is a statically generated, optimized and served by [Netlify CDN](https://netlify.com)
* chapters and articles are cross-linked so that you can navigate the books quickly
* type '/' to get book-scoped search for chapter and article types. This allows to quickly jump to a topic you're interested in

This project is collaborative. All documentation is released under Creative Commons BY-SA license.
