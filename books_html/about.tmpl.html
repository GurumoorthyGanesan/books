        About this project
    </h1>

    <p>
        This project is a continuation of Stack Overflow Documentation, which
        ended in <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/354217/sunsetting-documentation">August 2017</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The intent is to preserve the work that's been done so far and
        improve upon it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Those are guiding principles behind Essential Books:
        <ul>
            <li>fast</li>
            <li>driven by examples</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Fast means: fast to find the information. Here's how we make the documentation fast:
        <ul>
            <li>this website is a statically generated, optimized and served by <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify CDN</a></li>
            <li>chapters and articles are cross-linked so that you can
                navigate the books quickly
            </li>
            <li>type '/' to get book-scoped search for chapter and article types. This allows to quickly jump to a topic you're interested in</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
