You will immediately notice a large blue button saying “Upload to App Store…” however in 9/10 cases this will not work due to various reasons (Xcode bugs mostly). Workaround is to export your archive and upload it using another Xcode tool called Application Loader. However, since Application loader uploads IPA files to the App Store, archive needs to be exported to the correct format. This is a trivial task which might take ~ half an hour.
