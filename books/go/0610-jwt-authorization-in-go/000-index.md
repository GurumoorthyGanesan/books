## Remarks
context.Context and HTTP middleware are outside the scope of this topic, but nonetheless those curious, wandering souls should check out https://github.com/goware/jwtauth, https://github.com/auth0/go-jwt-middleware, and https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go.

Huge kudos to Dave Grijalva for his amazing work on go-jwt.
