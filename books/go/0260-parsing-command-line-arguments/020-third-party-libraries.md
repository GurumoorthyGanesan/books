Functionaly provided by standard library package [`flag`](https://golang.org/pkg/flag/) is limited.

There is a number of libraries that provide more functionality for command line parsing:

* [argparse](https://github.com/akamensky/argparse) - Command line argument parser inspired by Python's argparse module.
* [cli](https://github.com/mkideal/cli) - Feature-rich and easy to use command-line package based on golang struct tags.
* [cli](https://github.com/teris-io/cli) - Simple and complete API for building command line interfaces in Go.
* [cli-init](https://github.com/tcnksm/gcli) - The easy way to start building Golang command line applications.
* [climax](http://github.com/tucnak/climax) - Alternative CLI with "human face", in spirit of Go command.
* [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) - Commander for modern Go CLI interactions.
* [commandeer](https://github.com/jaffee/commandeer) - Dev-friendly CLI apps: sets up flags, defaults, and usage based on struct fields and tags.
* [docopt.go](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.go) - Command-line arguments parser that will make you smile.
* [flag](https://github.com/cosiner/flag) - Simple but powerful command line option parsing library for Go supporting subcommand.
* [go-arg](https://github.com/alexflint/go-arg) - Struct-based argument parsing in Go.
* [go-flags](https://github.com/jessevdk/go-flags) - go command line option parser.
* [gocmd](https://github.com/devfacet/gocmd) - Go library for building command line applications.
* [kingpin](https://github.com/alecthomas/kingpin) - Command line and flag parser supporting sub commands.
* [mitchellh/cli](https://github.com/mitchellh/cli) - Go library for implementing command-line interfaces.
* [mow.cli](https://github.com/jawher/mow.cli) - Go library for building CLI applications with sophisticated flag and argument parsing and validation.
* [pflag](https://github.com/spf13/pflag) - Drop-in replacement for Go's flag package, implementing POSIX/GNU-style --flags.
* [sflags](https://github.com/octago/sflags) - Struct based flags generator for flag, urfave/cli, pflag, cobra, kingpin and other libraries.
* [strumt](https://github.com/antham/strumt) - Library to create prompt chain.
* [ukautz/clif](https://github.com/ukautz/clif) - Small command line interface framework.
* [urfave/cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli) - Simple, fast, and fun package for building command line apps in Go (formerly codegangsta/cli).
