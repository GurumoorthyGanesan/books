Title: Zero values
Id: 6069
Remarks:
Each Go type has a zero value. Variable that has not been assigned value explicitly is set to zero value for that type.

Zero values are intuitive:
* integers: 0
* floating point numbers: 0.0
* string: empty string ("")
* pointer: nil
* slice: nil
* map: nil
* interface: nil
* function: nil
* array: all elements have zero value
* struct: each struct member is initialized with its zero value
