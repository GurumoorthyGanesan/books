## Base64 encode and decode

We can encode a `[]byte` into a `string` and decode from `string` into `[]byte`.

@file base64.go output sha1:ffc00d5cc31a71ad03f4157429df36714138ef55 goplayground:-6ZTG6fOfMx

## URL-safe base64

Original base64 encoding unfortunately might produce characters that are not valid in urls.

Given that urls are important those days we have a variant of base64 encoding that doesn't have that flaw:

@file base64_urlsafe.go output sha1:4feacf35a6de39f974e187af0f019b2d7810333e goplayground:lZiY1VDCk52

## Base64 encoding to writer, decoding from reader

For encoding and decoding larger values in streaming mode, we can encode to an `io.Writer` and decode from `io.Reader`.

@file base64_streaming.go output sha1:69009501f5d7c707a737cb8e1ed82a357f373a35 goplayground:0dWCqOxiW9Y
