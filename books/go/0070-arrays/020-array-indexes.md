Title: Array indexes
Id: 32352

Arrays values should be accessed using a number specifying the location of the desired value in the array. This number is called Index.

Indexes starts at **0** and finish at **array length -1**.

To access a value, you have to do something like this: `arrayName[index]`, replacing "index" by the number corresponding to the rank of the value in your array.

For example:

@file array_indexes.go output


To set or modify a value in the array, the way is the same.
Example:

@file array_indexes2.go output
