Title: Create array
Id: 1295
---
An array in go is an ordered collection of same types elements.
The basic notation to represent arrays is to use `[]` with the variable name.

Creating a new array looks like `var array = [size]Type`, replacing `size` by a number (for example `42` to specify it will be a list of 42 elements), and replacing `Type` by the type of the elements the array can contains (for example `int` or `string`)

Just below it's a code example showing the different way to create an array in Go.
