Create file `hello_world.go` and run it with `go run hello_world.go`.

@file hello_world.go output

[Playground](https://play.golang.org/p/I3l_5RKJts)

Once you are happy with the code it can be compiled to an executable with `go build hello.go`.

On Windows this will create `hello.exe` executable.

On every other OS, this will create `./hello` executable.
