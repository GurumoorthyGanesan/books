## The Go Playground

To test small snippets of Go code, you can use [The Go Playground](https://play.golang.org).

Playground has some limitations:
* it only supports standard library. You can't use third party libraries
* networking, file i/o is not available
* time is simulated

By using 'Share' button in the playground you can get a permanent link to code snippet and share it with others.
