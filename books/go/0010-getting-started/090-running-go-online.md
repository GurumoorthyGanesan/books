## The Go Playground ##

To test small snippets of Go code, you can use [The Go Playground](https://play.golang.org).

Playground has some limitations:
* it only supports standard library so you can't use third party libraries
* networking, file i/o is not available
* time is simulated

## Sharing your code ##

The Go Playground also has tools for sharing; if a user presses the “Share” button, a link (like [this one](https://play.golang.org/p/v3rrZLwEUC)) will be generated that can be sent to other people to test and edit.
