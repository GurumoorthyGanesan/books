String in Go is an immutable sequence of bytes (8-bit `byte` values)

This is different than languages like Python, C#, Java or Swift where strings are Unicode.

[Zero value](a-6069) of a `string` type is an empty string.

Basic string usage:

@file strings.go output sha1:91eac3e77ac970a27ff925b024315c74e8623ef6 goplayground:4dk4tTa9LPi
