Title: Reflection
Id: 1854
Remarks:
The [`reflect` docs](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/) are a great reference. In general computer programming, **reflection** is ability of a program to **examine** the structure and behavior of **itself** at **`runtime`**. 

Based on its strict `static type` system [Go](https://golang.org/) lang has some rules ([laws of reflection](https://blog.golang.org/laws-of-reflection))
