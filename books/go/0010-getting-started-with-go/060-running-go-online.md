## The Go Playground ##

One little known Go tool is **[The Go Playground](https://play.golang.org)**. If one wants to experiment with Go without downloading it, they can easily do so simply by . . .

1. Visiting the [Playground](https://play.golang.org) in their web browser
2. Entering their code
3. Clicking “Run”

## Sharing your code ##

The Go Playground also has tools for sharing; if a user presses the “Share” button, a link (like [this one](https://play.golang.org/p/v3rrZLwEUC)) will be generated that can be sent to other people to test and edit.

## In action ##
