Basics of `if`:

@file index.go output sha1:e425791f3ab0fed4e5b51c9f8f1b6eead8d1b938 goplayground:_evOxv3H5Ml

Basics of `switch`:

@file index2.go output sha1:4218c05161df22f3d33878a09a7ec35871a23226 goplayground:veunNs8q2gk

Notice that unlike in C++, `case` statement doesn't fall throught to the next `case`, so you don't have to put `break` at the end of each `case`.

Switch is also used as a [type switch](96).
